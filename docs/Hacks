Added a bunch of rules to Jamrules

Modifying mupdf/Jamfile to exclude fontdump and cmapdump from the build process.

*WARNING*

You must build the cmap source files before continuing on to the flash build.

First run jam in a clean environment (without alc-on).

Then look into build/your-computer-architecture/

Copy cmap_*.c to mupdf/cmaps/

Copy font_cjk.c to mupdf/fonts/droid/

Copy the remaining font_*.c to mupdf/fonts/

Added CFLAGS to the linker

Adding -Drestrict because llvm isn't honoring the restrict keyword
